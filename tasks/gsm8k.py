GSM8K evaluation.

Example problem instance:

Question:
Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
Answer:
Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.
Working 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.
#### 10

Notice that GSM8K uses tool calls inside << >> tags.
